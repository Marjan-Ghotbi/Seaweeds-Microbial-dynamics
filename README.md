# Seaweeds-Microbial-dynamics


Abstract
The surface microbiome of seaweed hosts is a multi-domain biofilm regulated by host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. The extent to which hosts influence these interactions, and potentially affect their resilience and invasion success, remains unclear. We experimentally tested whether hosts with invasion history exert more influence over their biofilms than native hosts. Biofilm formation on proxy surfaces adjacent to one invasive (Gracilaria vermiculophylla) and two native (Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus) perennial hosts was monitored and compared to mature epiphytic biofilms of the same hosts. Only Gracilaria’s proxy biofilms were significantly different in community composition compared to control surfaces. Gracilaria’s proxy biofilms also showed the highest similarity to their adjacent algae with some bacterial taxa and associations significantly shared between them, suggesting the host influence on colonization of the proxy surface. Gracilaria and its proxy biofilm showed highest similarity in microbial network variables, indicating a higher ability of the invader to control connectivity and microbial associations within its biofilm. Mature biofilms on Gracilaria showed lower prokaryotic diversity compared to Fucus species, but higher diversity and community stability in the core microbiome; implying a greater ability of the invasive host to maintain more diverse persistent microbes. Meanwhile Gracilaria’s mature biofilm also showed higher variability in its prokaryotic composition over experiments, which was also reflected in a less robust microbial network. This suggests the invasive host exhibits 
stronger influence but also more flexibility towards the environmental microbes, indicating higher controlling and simultaneously acclimatization potential, which may contribute to why it thrives in new ecosystems.
